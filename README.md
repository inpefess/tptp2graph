# TPTP2Graph

The purpose of this package is to transform [TPTP](https://tptp.org) formulae parsed by [this package](https://github.com/inpefess/tptp-grpc) to graphs stored in the [protobuf](https://protobuf.dev) format to be usable by the [Deep Graph Library](https://dgl.ai).

# How to build

git clone https://github.com/inpefess/tptp2graph/tptp2graph.git
cd tptp2graph
./gradlew build

# How to run the a transofrmation

Assuming you have parsed protobuf binaries generated by [tptp-grpc](https://github.com/inpefess/tptp-grpc) in the folder ``proto-binaries``:

```sh
find absolute_path_to_proto-binares -name "*.pb" > proto-binaries-list.txt
mkdir output
./gradlew run -PmainClassToRun=com.github.inpefess.tptp2graph.tptp2graph.TPTPProto2Graph --args="absolute_path_to_proto-binaries-list.txt absolute_path_to_output_folder"
```
